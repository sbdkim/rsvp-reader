## 🧩 Why RSVP + ORP?

Traditional reading requires constant eye movement (saccades), which can reduce focus and speed.

RSVP works by:
- Keeping the eye fixed in one place
- Presenting words sequentially
- Highlighting the **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** — the letter your brain naturally locks onto

This approach:
- Reduces eye strain
- Improves focus
- Helps maintain attention for ADHD readers
- Enables faster comprehension with practice
