# RSVP Reader (ORP)

A small web app for experimenting with **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)** reading.

It shows text one word at a time, highlights the **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** letter in red, and lets you control reading speed and text size in real time.  
I built this mainly to explore focus-friendly reading patterns (especially for ADHD), and to better understand RSVP-style interfaces.

## What it does

- Displays text one word at a time (RSVP)
- Highlights the ORP letter for each word
- Adjustable reading speed (words per minute)
- Adjustable text size
- Play / pause / reset controls
- Step backward and forward
- Optional fixation guide line
- Small pause after punctuation
- Keyboard shortcuts for most actions

## Why RSVP?

Normal reading involves a lot of eye movement.  
RSVP keeps your eyes fixed in one place and moves the words instead.

Highlighting the ORP (the letter your brain tends to lock onto) helps reduce recognition time and makes higher speeds feel more manageable. It’s not for everyone, but it can be useful for focus or speed-reading practice.
