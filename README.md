# RSVP Speed Reader

A web-based speed reading tool that uses Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to help you read faster and stay focused. Perfect for people with ADHD or anyone looking to improve their reading speed.

## What is RSVP?

RSVP flashes one word at a time on screen with the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP) highlighted in red. Instead of your eyes scanning left to right across lines of text, you focus on a single point while words appear sequentially. This eliminates the need for eye movement and significantly boosts reading speed.

The red letter marks the spot where your eyes should naturally fixate - usually slightly left of center in each word. Your peripheral vision handles the rest.

## Features

- **Adjustable reading speed** - Start at 300 WPM and work your way up to 1000+ WPM
- **Customizable font size** - Make it comfortable for any screen or viewing distance
- **Progress tracking** - See exactly where you are in your text
- **Playback controls** - Start, pause, reset, or resume anytime
- **Clean, distraction-free interface** - Nothing to mess with your focus

## Tech Stack

Just vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks, no build process, no dependencies (except Tailwind CSS loaded from CDN for styling). 

I wanted to keep this dead simple so anyone can use it without installing a bunch of stuff.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in any browser
2. Paste your text (or use the default intro text)
3. Click "Start Reading"
4. Adjust speed and font size in settings if needed
5. Focus on the red letter and let your brain do the rest

## Deployment

Since it's just a single HTML file, you can:
- Open it locally in your browser (double-click the file)
- Host it on GitHub Pages
- Drop it on Netlify
- Throw it on any static hosting service

No server required, no compilation step, no nothing. Just upload and go.

## Why I Built This

I've always struggled with staying focused while reading long articles or documentation. Traditional speed reading techniques felt awkward, but RSVP actually works - it forces your brain to stay engaged with the content instead of wandering off mid-paragraph.

Started as a weekend project to help myself read faster. Figured others might find it useful too.

## Contributing

This is a pretty straightforward tool, but if you have ideas for improvements, feel free to fork it and make it your own. Some things I've thought about adding:
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Save reading position
- Text-to-speech option
- Different highlighting styles
